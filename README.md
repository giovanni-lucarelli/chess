# Chess RL Project

![](python/chessrl/algorithms/value_iteration/chess_sequence.gif)

This repository contains the final project for the **Reinforcement Learning** exam at the **University of Trieste**.

The objective is to develop a chess game environment and implement various **Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms** to solve simplified chess scenarios with a limited number of pieces, commonly known in chess terminology as **endgames**.

Project goals:

1. **Chess Environment Implementation** — A custom environment to simulate chess positions and moves.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms** — Design and train RL agents to play and solve specific endgame scenarios.


> **Note:** This README provides a high-level summary of the project structure, build instructions, and usage guidelines. For detailed documentation and design notes, please refer to the [`doc/`](./doc/) directory.

### Component Overview

**Core Engine (C++)**
- `include/` + `src/`: Core chess implementation
- `build/ChessEngine`: Standalone executable for command-line play
- `test/`: Unit tests for validation

**User Interfaces**
- `assets/`: Visual chess piece representations

**Build & Development**
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Cross-platform build configuration
- `docs/`: Technical documentation and research materials

## Build Instructions

1. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2. Configure the project using CMake:
    ```sh
    cmake ..
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

### Running the Engine

- To run the chess game executable:
    ```sh
    ./Chess
    # or
    make play
    ```

- To run the tests:
    ```sh
    ./ChessTests
    # or
    ctest --verbose
    ```

- To clean the build dir:
    ```sh
    make clean_all
    ```
## Clone & set up a virtual environment

```
git clone <this-repo-url> chess_RL
cd chess_RL

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -U pip
```
install the python package
```
pip install -e .

```

## Dependencies
