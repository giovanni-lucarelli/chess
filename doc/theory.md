## About the game of chess

From [Chess Programming](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Chess):

>Chess is a two-player zero-sum abstract strategy board game with perfect information as classified by John von Neumann. Chess has an estimated state-space complexity of $10^{46}$, the estimated game tree complexity of $10^{123}$ is based on an average branching factor of $35$ and an average game length of $80$ ply (*i.e.* half-move).
